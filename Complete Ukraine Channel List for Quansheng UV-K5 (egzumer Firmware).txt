Notes
Legal Status in Ukraine (NCCIR Regulations)
Licence-Free:
PMR446: Channels 0–7 (446.00625–446.09375 MHz, 0.5W max). Harmonized with EU standards, widely used for personal communication.
LPD433: Channels 8–15, 59–62, 80–83, 108–111, 176–179, 194–198 (433.075–433.800 MHz, 10mW max, 25 kHz steps). Common for short-range devices.
Amateur Radio: Requires an amateur radio licence from the Ukrainian Amateur Radio League (UARL) or NCCIR:
6m: 35–36, 63–64, 76, 112–113 (50–52 MHz, up to 100W depending on category).
2m: 16–19, 39, 42–43, 65, 77, 91–92, 114–115, 163–164, 180, 183–184 (144–146 MHz, up to 100W).
70cm: 20–23, 40, 44–45, 66, 78, 93–94, 116–117, 165–166, 181, 185–186 (430–440 MHz, up to 100W).
23cm: 37–38, 79, 118–119, 162, 182 (1240–1300 MHz, up to 100W).
Restricted Bands: RX-only unless specifically licensed (e.g., maritime or aviation permits):
Marine VHF: 24–28, 46–53, 67–70, 84–86, 95–102, 167–171, 187 (156–162 MHz, RX only unless licensed for maritime use).
Airband: 29–31, 54–55, 71–72, 87–88, 103–104, 172–173, 188–189 (118–136 MHz, RX only unless licensed for aviation).
Experimental: 120–162 (50–1300 MHz outside allocated bands, TX illegal without special permission).
FM Radio: RX-only presets (32–34, 56–58, 73–75, 89–90, 105–107, 174–175, 190–193, 199): 87–108 MHz, varies by region (Kyiv-focused here).
Technical Considerations
Stock TX Bands: 136–174 MHz (VHF), 400–470 MHz (UHF) offer ~5W and proper filtering.
Unlocked TX Bands: Enabled via hidden menu (PTT + Side Button 1, set F Lock to “Custom” or “All”):
50–136 MHz (6m, airband): ~2–4W, possible spurious emissions.
174–400 MHz: Poor sensitivity, TX risky.
470–1300 MHz (upper UHF, SHF): <1W, hardware-limited (BK4819 chip lacks filtering).
Programming: Use CHIRP with egzumer driver (Radio > Download/Upload) or manual entry (VFO mode, F + M). FM presets saved in FM mode (F + M).
